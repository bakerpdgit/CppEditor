# AGENTS

This project is a browser-based C++ editor that compiles and runs code with
WebAssembly.

- Use 2-space indentation in JavaScript and HTML files.
- Prefer double quotes for strings in JavaScript.
- Run `npm test` after changes even though no test suite exists; capture its
  output for logs.
