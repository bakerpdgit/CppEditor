# AGENTS

This project is a browser-based C++ editor that compiles and runs code with
WebAssembly building on third party clang and lld wasm tools and also the monaco editor.

The site is styled using material-components.

- Use 2-space indentation in JavaScript and HTML files.
- Prefer double quotes for strings in JavaScript.
- Skip running `npm test` after changes because no test suite exists
